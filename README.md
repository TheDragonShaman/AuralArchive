### Automatic Downloads

Enable automatic downloads to have AuralArchive monitor your library and automatically acquire books as they become available. The system evaluates all configured sources and selects the best available option based on quality, seeders, and availability. Set quality thresholds and download preferences to ensure you always get the format and quality you want.
